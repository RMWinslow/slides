## Some Minor Empirical Notes:

---

### Average Hours for Part-time workers

- Average hours for part-time workers in CPS data: 22-23 hours.
- But CPS defines part-time as no more than 35 hours per week.
- Conditional on working 1-20 hours, the average is 14-15.
- So lower value for $ĥ_p$ is reasonable.

---

### Does Part-Time employment have a spike like PUI?

- During the pandemic, both full and partial UI spiked upwards. Moreover, PUI increased as a *share* of total UI benefits.
- In CPS, part-time employment did spike upwards, but relatively less than unemployment did. This results in the opposite pattern in ratio of P to U as seen in UI.

- Same graph but with part-time work restricted to those who work 20 hours or less.
