## The Probability Generating Function

$X$ is a discrete random variable with support $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ 
and probability mass function $p_X$. 
Then we define the probability generating function $G_X(ðŸ™‚)$ as

$$G_X(ðŸ™‚)\equiv E[ðŸ™‚^X] = \sum\_{x=0}^\infty \left[ p\_X (x) \cdot ðŸ™‚^x \right]$$

---

## Useful Properties of the PGF

### We can easily sum variables: 

If $Y$ and $W$ are independent (discrete random variables with support $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$), and $X\sim aY + bW$, then 

$$G_X(ðŸ˜¬)=G\_Y(ðŸ˜¬^a)\cdot G\_W(ðŸ˜¬^b)$$

---

## Useful Properties of the PGF


### We can easily sum variables.

- In particular, if $x\_1,X\_2,...,X\_N$ are iid, and $Y\sim \sum\_i X\_i$, then

$$G\_Y(ðŸ™‚) = [G\_X(ðŸ™‚)]^N$$

---

## Useful Properties of the PGF

### Compound Distributions

If $N$ itself is a discrete random variables with support $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, 
which is independent of $X\_i$, 
and if $Y\sim \sum^N\_{i=1} X_i$ is the sum of $N$ iid draws of $X$, then 

$$G\_Y(ðŸ™‚) = G\_N(G\_X(ðŸ™‚))$$

## Useful Properties of the PGF

### Compound Distributions

If $N$ itself is a discrete random variables with support $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, 
which is independent of $X_i$, 
and if $Y\sim \sum^N\_{i=1} X_i$ is the sum of $N$ iid draws of $X$, then 

$G_Y(ðŸ™‚) = G\_N(G\_X(ðŸ™‚))$

In particular, if $N$ is iid to $X$, then 

$$G_Y(ðŸ™‚) = G\_X(G\_X(ðŸ™‚))$$

## Useful Properties of the PGF

### Moments

Derivative wrt ðŸ™‚ is $\sum_{x=0}^\infty \left[x \cdot p\_X (x) \cdot ðŸ™‚^{x-1} \right]$  and therefore 

$$G^\prime(1)=E[X]$$


---

## Useful Properties of the PGF

### Moments

Derivative wrt ðŸ™‚ is $\sum_{x=0}^\infty \left[x \cdot p\_X (x) \cdot ðŸ™‚^{x-1} \right]$  and therefore 

$$G^\prime(1)=E[X]$$

And in general, the $n$th derivative gives the $n$th factorial moment. 

$$G^{\prime n} (1) = E\left[\frac{x^!}{(x-r)!}\right]$$

---

## Useful Properties of the PGF

### Zeros:

$$G_X(0) = \sum\_{x=0}^\infty \left[ p\_X (x) \cdot 0^x \right] = p\_0$$

---

## Useful Properties of the PGF

Note that if $X$ is a constant random variable equal to 1, then 

$$G_x(ðŸ™‚) = \sum\_{x=0}^\infty \left[ p\_X (x) \cdot ðŸ™‚^x \right]$$

$$G_x(ðŸ™‚) =  ðŸ™‚$$

This also means that the pgf for $1+Y$ is $ðŸ™‚\cdot G_Y(ðŸ™‚)$



---

## Useful Properties of the PGF

Also we can get the pmf back out

$$p_X(x) = \frac{1}{k!}\frac{\partial^k}{\partial x^k} G\_0 |\_{x=0}$$

## Applications to Branching Problems

- Start with a single individual.
- This individual has offspring distribution $Z$
- All of their descendents also have iid offspring distributions $Z$


---

## Applications to Branching Problems


If $G=G_Z$, and the 0th generation has 1 individual, then
- The number of descendents in the first generation has generating function $G(ðŸ™‚)$
- '' in the second generation '' $G(G(ðŸ™‚)) = G^2(ðŸ™‚)$
- '' in the third generation '' $G(G((ðŸ™‚))) = G^3(ðŸ™‚)$
- '' in the $g$th generation is $G^g(ðŸ™‚)$

## Applications to Branching Problems

### Extinction

- $G(0)$ gives the chance that the initial individual will have no children
- $G(G(0))$ gives the chance they will have no grandchildren
- $G^g(0)$ gives the chance that the lineage will have died out by generation $g$.


---

## Applications to Branching Problems

### Extinction

The chance that the lineage will ultimately go extinct is 

$$\lim_{g\to\infty} G^g(0) = G^\infty(0)$$

---

## Applications to Branching Problems

### Extinction

The chance that the lineage will ultimately go extinct is 

$$\lim_{g\to\infty} G^g(0) = G^\infty(0)$$

- Note that $G^\infty$ has the property that $G^\infty(0)=G(G^\infty(0))$, 
- and that there is at most one $ðŸ’€\in (0,1)$ such that $G(ðŸ’€)=ðŸ’€$
- Iff $\mu_Z = G^\prime(1)\geq 1$, then there is a unique positive solution for $G^\infty(0)$ $\in(0,1)$
- If $\mu_X < 1$, then $G^\infty(0)=1$

### Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence

### Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence

- Each individual $x$ is assumed to spread disease according to a Poisson process with individual specific mean $v_x$. 
- These individual attack rates are Gamma-distributed 
- The Gamma-Poisson mixture distribution has pgf

$G_Z(ðŸ™‚) = \left(\left(1-ðŸ™‚\right)\frac{R_{0}}{k}+1\right)^{-k}$

- High dispersion parameter $k$ makes outbreaks more volatile. Has implications for the targetting of government intervention

### Spread of epidemic disease on networks

- The degree distribution of nodes has mean $z$ and  pgf labelled $G_0$
- Choose a random edge, and travel to one of it's endpoints. The degree distribution of such nodes is labelled $G_1$ and $G_1(x)=\frac{G^\prime(0)}{z}$.
- Edge percolation: edges are removed iid with probability $1-T$
  - Degree distribution of non-removed edges is labelled $G_0(x;T)$
  - Degree distribution of non-removed edges of nodes reachable by travelling along a random non-remove edge is labelled $G_1(x;T)$

- Relationships are establish between these distributions.
