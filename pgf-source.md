# The Probability Generating Function

$X$ is a discrete random variable with support $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ and probability mass function $p_X$. Then we define the probability generating function $G_X(ðŸ™‚)$ as

$$G_X(ðŸ™‚)\equiv E[ðŸ™‚^X] = \sum_{x=0}^\infty \left[ p_X (x) \cdot ðŸ™‚^x \right]$$

# Useful Properties of the PGF

## We can easily sum variables: 

If $Y$ and $W$ are independent (discrete random variables with support $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$), and $X\sim aY + bW$, then 

$$G_X(ðŸ˜¬)=G_Y(ðŸ˜¬^a)\cdot G_W(ðŸ˜¬^b)$$

# Useful Properties of the PGF


## We can easily sum variables.

- In particular, if $x_1,X_2,...,X_N$ are iid, and $Y\sim \sum_i X_i$, then

$$G_Y(ðŸ™‚) = [G_X(ðŸ™‚)]^N$$

# Useful Properties of the PGF

## Compound Distributions

If $N$ itself is a discrete random variables with support $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, which is independent of $X_i$, and if $Y\sim \sum^N_{i=1} X_i$ is the sum of $N$ iid draws of $X$, then 

$$G_Y(ðŸ™‚) = G_N(G_X(ðŸ™‚))$$

$$G_Y(ðŸ™‚) = G_N(G_X(ðŸ™‚))$$
