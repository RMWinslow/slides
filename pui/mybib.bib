Summarized by chetty2020 as "However,fiscal policy itself does not have the capacity to restore full employment when the initial shock to consumer spending arises from health concerns"


Chapter of a textbook about social insurance.
Main things worth citing are:
That only 97 percent of wage and salary workers are in jobs that are eligible, but that only 40 percent of unemployed collect. Mainly due to work history requirement.
Second is that it summarizes some evidence that UI does indeed disincentivize work. Has a lot of other citations there if I want some old ones.

I thought I might recalculate the job-finding rate using Shimer's method here,
but on second glance, it's too complicated to spend that much time on for now.
