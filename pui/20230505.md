## How is time use determined.

- Benefits depend both on the current week's gross earnings, 
(denoted $w$ in the following slides),
and on the individual's "Weekly Benefit Amount" (WBA).
- Your WBA is the amount you collect when totally unemployed.
    - Except for high earners, it's about half of your typical income.
    - Constant throughout entire UI spell.

Benefits schedule:
- Roughly speaking, benefits $b  =WBA - \frac{3}{4}w$
- Benefits cut off when $w > \frac{4}{3}w$. 
- (There's also a few extra caveats for those with very low income.)

## State UI in NY


During the pandemic, the rule was that to receive benefits:

- you must be working reduced hours
- this week's gross earnings must be no more than 504 dollars
- you must work no more than three days this week
    - each day worked reduces benefits by 25%

As of August 2021, the rule is the same, save that "days worked" 
are now defined in terms of hours worked.
