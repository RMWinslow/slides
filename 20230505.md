## State UI in CA

Benefits schedule:
Roughly speaking, benefits $b  =WBA - \frac{3}{4} we$.
Benefits cut off when $we > \frac{4}{3}we$.
(There's also a few extra caveats for those with very low income.)

## State UI in NY


During the pandemic, the rule was that to receive benefits:

- you must be working reduced hours
- this week's gross earnings must be no more than 504 dollars
- you must work no more than three days this week
    - each day worked reduces benefits by 25%

As of August 2021, the rule is the same, save that "days worked" 
are now defined in terms of hours worked.

## State UI in TX


In Texas, the rule is $b = WBA$ if $w < \frac{WBA}{4}$,
and $b = \frac{5}{4}WBA - w$ if $\frac{WBA}{4} \leq w \leq \frac{5}{4}WBA$.
Benefits cut off when $we > \frac{5}{4}WBA$.

## State UI in IL


In Illinois, the rule is $b = WBA$ if $w < \frac{WBA}{2}$,
and $b = \frac{3}{2}WBA$ if $\frac{WBA}{2} \leq w < WBA$.
Benefits cut off when $we \geq WBA$.
This means there's a cliff.
