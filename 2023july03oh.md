## Model

- Simple model of job search and unemployment insurance.
- Based on:
    - *The role of unemployment insurance in an economy with liquidity constraints and moral hazard* (Hansen, Imrohoroğlu, 1992)
    - *Unemployment insurance and the role of self-insurance.* (Abdulkadiroğlu, Kuruşçu, Şahin, 2002).
- My contribution is the addition of *partial* unemployment insurance.

### Consumer's choices

The consumer's optimand is straightforward:

$$\mathbb{E} \sum_j \beta^t U(c_t,l_t) = \mathbb{E} \sum_t \beta^t \frac{(c_t^{1-\sigma}l_t^\sigma)^{1-\rho}-1}{1-\rho}$$

Two decisions the consumer faces:

1. How to split income between consumption and (non-interest-bearing) savings
    - budget is $m'+c = m+y_d$, where $m$ is assets, and $y_d$ is disposable income.
    - assets are subject to the constraint $m'\geq 0$

2. Whether and how much to work when give a job opportunity. (See next slide.)

<!--These basics are very similar to (Abdulkadiroğlu, Kuruşçu, Şahin, (2002)).-->

---


### Job Search



- Employment opportunity $s\in\set{e,p,u}$ represents whether the person has a job opportunity ($s=e$), a partial job opportunity ($s=p$) or no job opportunity ($s=u$). (Employment, Partial employment, full Unemployment)
    - $s$ evolves according to a 3x3 transition matrix $\chi$, <!--TODO: Calibrate-->

$$\chi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
   \chi(e,e) & \chi(e,p) & \chi(e,u) \\
   \chi(p,e) & \chi(p,p) & \chi(p,u) \\
   \chi(u,e) & \chi(u,p) & \chi(u,u) 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- employment status $\eta\in\Set{\etaE,\etaP,\etaU}$ represents the level of work the consumer actually chooses to engage in. 
    - If $s=\sE$, consumer can choose from $\eta\in\Set{\etaE,\etaP,\etaU}$
    - If $s=\sP$, consumer can choose from $\eta\in\Set{\etaP,\etaU}$
    - If $s=\sU$, consumer must choose $\eta = \etaU$


<!--
- Note that $s=u \implies \eta=0$. But if the person chooses not to accept an employment opportunity, $(s,\eta)=(e,0)$.
-->


---

### Unemployment Benefits

$\mu\in\set{0,1}$ is a binary variable indicating whether the person collects unemployment benefits.

- If $s=\sE$, then $\mu=0$
- If $(s,\eta)=(\sP,\etaP)$ or $(\sU,\etaU)$, then $\mu=1$
- If $\eta=\etaU$, but $s\neq\sU$, then $\mu=1$ with probability $\pi_u$, 0 otherwise
- If $\eta=\etaP$, but $s\neq\sP$, then $\mu=1$ with probability $\pi_p$, 0 otherwise

If Consumer collects benefits, the benefits adjust their disposable income to some fraction of employed disposable income, called the "replacement rate".

-  $\theta_p$ is replacement rate for partially employed (when $(\eta,\mu)=(\etaP,1)$)
-  $\theta_u$ is replacement rate for unemployed (when $(\eta,\mu)=(\etaU,1)$)


<!--TODO?: Make pi dependent on s, eta, and previous s or eta?-->

### Utility Flows, Income, and Leisure

Given $(m,m',\eta,\mu)$, utility flow is:

$$U\Big(m-m'+y_d(\eta,\mu),\;l(\eta)\Big)$$

where

$$
y_d(\eta,\mu) =
\begin{cases}
   (1-\tau)y                &\text{if } (\eta,\mu)=(\etaE,0) \\
   (1-\tau)yθ_p             &\text{if } (\eta,\mu)=(\etaP,1) \\
   (1-\tau)yθ_u             &\text{if } (\eta,\mu)=(\etaU,1) \\
   (1-\tau)y\frac{\hP}{\hE} &\text{if } (\eta,\mu)=(\etaP,0) \\
   0                        &\text{if } (\eta,\mu)=(\etaU,0) \\
\end{cases}
$$

and

$$
l(\eta) =
\begin{cases}
   1-\hE &\text{if } \eta=\etaE \\
   1-\hP &\text{if } \eta=\etaP \\
   1 &\text{if } \eta=\etaU \\
\end{cases}
$$

---

### Timeline Within Each Period



1. Consumer recieves potential job offer $s\in\set{e,p,u}$
2. Consumer chooses employment status $\eta\in\Set{\etaE,\etaP,\etaU}$
3. Draw $\mu\in\set{0,1}$: does Consumer get unemployment benefits?   
4. Consumer chooses $m'$ after seeing $\mu$




---

### Value Functions

$$
V(e,m) = \max_{\eta\in\set{\etaE,\etaP,\etaU}}\Big\lbrace
\mathbb{E} \left[\max_{m'}\Set{U(m-m'+y_d(\eta,\mu),l(\eta))+cont(e,m')}\right]
\Big\rbrace
$$

$$
V(p,m) = \max_{\eta\in\set{\etaP,\etaU}}\Big\lbrace
\mathbb{E} \left[\max_{m'}\Set{U(m-m'+y_d(\eta,\mu),l(\eta))+cont(p,m')}\right]
\Big\rbrace
$$

$$
V(u,m) = \max_{m'}\Set{U(m-m'+y_d(\eta,\mu),l(\eta))+cont(u,m')}
$$

where

$$cont(s,m') \equiv \beta \sum_{s'}\chi(s,s')V(m',s')$$

### Market Clearing and Equilibrium

State of a person is $x=(m,s,\eta,\mu)$

Stationary equilibrium consists of 
- decision rules $\eta(m,s)$, $c(x)$, $m'(x)$
- time-invariant measure $\lambda(x)$ of people in state $x$
- tax rate $\tau$

Such that

- Given $\tau$, the decision rules are optimal for the consumers.
- Goods market clears: 

$$\sum_x \lambda(x) c(x) = \sum_x \lambda(x) \cdot 
\begin{cases}
y                &\text{if }\eta=\etaE\\
\frac{\hP}{\hE}y &\text{if }\eta=\etaP\\
0                &\text{if }\eta=\etaU\\
\end{cases}
$$

- $\lambda(x')=\lambda(x)$
- Government budget  balanced (?):

## Progress Report

- Implemented the model from (Sahin 2002), with savings, and verified that I get the same results.
    - Value Function Iteration
    - Measure Iteration
    - Finding equilibrium
- Implemented and tested the Value Function Iteration for the model described today.


Next to do:

- Finish modifying Measure Iteration and Equilibrium Finding to the new model.

### Market Clearing and Equilibrium

State of a person is $x=(m,s,t,\mu)$

Stationary equilibrium consists of 
- decision rules $\eta(m,s,t)$, $c(x)$, $m'(x)$
- time-invariant measure $\lambda(x)$ of people in state $x$
- tax rate $\tau$

Such that

- Given $\tau$, the decision rule is optimal for the consumers.
- Goods market clears: $\sum_x \lambda(x) c(x) = \sum_x \lambda(x) \eta(x)y$
- $\lambda(x')=\lambda(x)$
- Government budget  balanced:

$$\sum_{m,t}\lambda(m,e,t,\textcolor{red}{0})\eta(m,e,t)\tau y =
\sum_{m,s,t}\lambda(m,s,t,\textcolor{red}{1})(1-\tau)\theta(t)y$$

### Social Planner's Problem

$$\max\sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t \lbrack N_t U(c_{1t}, 1-\hat h) + (1-N_t)U(c_{2t},1) \rbrack$$

subject to 

$$N_t c_{1t} +  (1-N_t) c_{2t} \leq N_t y, \;\; N_t \leq \bar N$$


Where 
- $N_t$ is employment rate, 
- $c_{1t}$ is consumption for employed people
- $c_{2t}$ is consumption for unemployed people
- $\bar N$ is set to 0.94

In the following slide, welfare cost of an equilibrium
is given as $1-\phi$,
where $phi$ is the value such that $(\phi c_{1t}, \phi c_{2t})$
gives the same average utility as the equilibrium allocations.

### Summary of Optimal Plans

$\pi(1)=1$ for all of the following:

| Case | $\theta$ | emp rate | $1-\phi$ | 
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| T=1, No savings, $\pi(0)=0$ | .25 | .94 | 2.50% |
| T=4, No savings, $\pi(0)=0$ | .65, .65, .65, .3 | .90 | 0.485% |
| T=1, No savings, $\pi(0)=1$ | .25 | .94 | 2.50% |
| T=4, No savings, $\pi(0)=1$ | .3, .25, .25., .2 | .94 | 2.50% |
| Savings, no UI | 0 | .94 | 0.683% |
| T=1, Savings, , $\pi(0)=0$ | .05 | .94 | 0.683% |
| T=4, Savings, $\pi(0)=0$ | .95, 0, 0, .1 | .94 | 0.483% |
| T=1, Savings, $\pi(0)=1$ | 0 | .94 | 0.683% |
| T=4, Savings, $\pi(0)=1$ | 0, 0, .05, .05 |  | 0.634% |
