### Model of Job Search

Three more state variables are introduced: $s,\eta,\mu$.

- Employment opportunity $s\in\set{e,p,u}$ represents whether the person has a job opportunity ($s=e$), a partial job opportunity ($s=p$) or no job opportunity ($s=u$).
    - $s$ evolves according to a 3x3 transition matrix $\chi$, <!--TODO: Calibrate-->

$$\chi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
   \chi(e,e) & \chi(e,p) & \chi(e,u) \\
   \chi(p,e) & \chi(p,p) & \chi(p,u) \\
   \chi(u,e) & \chi(u,p) & \chi(u,u) 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- employment status $\eta\in\Set{E,P,U}$ represents what 
- $\mu\in\set{0,1}$ indicates whether the person collects unemployment benefits.
    - If $(s,\eta)=(e,0)$, there is a probability $\pi(t)$ that the person collects benefits and probability $1-\pi(t)$ they do not.
    - Otherwise, $\mu$ works as you'd expect. 
        - $(s,\eta)=(e,1) \implies \mu=0$, 
        - and $s=u \implies \eta=0, \mu=1$

<!--
- Note that $s=u \implies \eta=0$. But if the person chooses not to accept an employment opportunity, $(s,\eta)=(e,0)$.
