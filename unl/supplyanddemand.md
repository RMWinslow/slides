# Supply and Demand

<!--
For your visit, you will be guest lecturing a 75-minute principles of Microeconomics course (150 students). The class will be on demand and supply equilibrium, and I have attached to this email, a scanned copy of the chapter from the text used in the class (Stevenson and Wolfers). Please use this in preparing for the guest lecture. The class as taught, uses the flipped classroom format and so students may be coming into the class with some background knowledge. As such, you may wish to focus more on problem solving. I have also copied the instructor of the class: Mike Ricks, feel free to reach out to him if you have any questions or concerns.
