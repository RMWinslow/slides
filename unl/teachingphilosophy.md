# Teaching Philosophy

<!--
As for the teaching philosophy seminar, this will be a 20-minute talk about your approach in the classroom covering preparation, lecture style, student engagement, assessment, technology, etc. It should give faculty an idea of your approach to teaching in general. Be sure to contrast what you would do in a regular class with what you would do in the guest lecture since you will be somewhat limited. The remaining 10 minutes will be allocated for questions should the faculty have any.
